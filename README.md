# Email-Header-Analysis

Email Header Analysis involves scrutinizing the metadata of an email to extract information about its source and legitimacy. It helps identify potential spam, phishing attempts,
or suspicious activities. By examining sender, recipient, date, and routing details, we can determine if an email is trustworthy. MX Tools are online services that validate email
server configurations, aiding in diagnosing email delivery problems.
